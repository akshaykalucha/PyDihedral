# Py-Dihedral
In general, a dihedral group is defined D<sub>n</sub> as a group of symmetries in a regular polygon of n-vertices. We think of this polygon as having vertices on the unit circle, these groups are most simple examples of any finite-group, and play major role in mathematics and physics.
with vertices labeled 0, 1, . . . , n−1 starting at (1, 0) and proceeding counterclockwise
at angles in multiples of 360/n degrees, that is, 2π/n radians. For example, D<sub>3</sub> represents the symmetries of a triangle.

## Project Description
In this code, a python class is implemented that outputs the structures of group of D<sub>n</sub> and also contains methods for generation and verification of subgroups and applying transformations as well.
