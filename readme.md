# Py-Dihedral
In general, a dihedral group is defined D<sub>n</sub> as a group of symmetries in a regular polygon of n-vertices. We think of this polygon as having vertices on the unit circle,
with vertices labeled 0, 1, . . . , n−1 starting at (1, 0) and proceeding counterclockwise
at angles in multiples of 360/n degrees, that is, 2π/n radians. For example, D<sub>3</sub> represents the symmetries of a triangle.
